# Keshet React Client

Minimal Vite + React front end that connects to the Laravel API (`server`) and renders the department landing screen shown in the mock.

## Getting started

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Add the provided logo as `client/public/logo.png` (replace the placeholder).  

Set the API base URL in `.env` (production default is `https://qclient.iqdesk.xyz/server/api`):

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

Then open the URL Vite prints (default `http://localhost:5173`).
